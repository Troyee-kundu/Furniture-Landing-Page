├── Img/
│   └── (images used in hero, features, etc.)
├── index.html
├── style.css
└── README.md             ← (this file)

````

- `index.html` — main HTML page  
- `style.css` — CSS styles  
- `Img/` — folder containing image assets  

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You’ll need a web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, etc.).  
Optionally, a local web server (e.g. VSCode Live Server, `http-server`, etc.) to test locally with proper routing (not strictly required for a single‑page static site).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Troyee-kundu/Furniture-Landing-Page.git
````

2. Change directory:

   ```bash
   cd Furniture-Landing-Page
   ```

### Running Locally

You can open `index.html` directly in your browser:

* Double-click `index.html` or right-click → “Open with Browser”.

Or, run via a local server for better support of relative paths:

```bash
# If you have http-server installed via npm:
http-server .

# Or using Python’s simple HTTP server:
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## Usage

* Use this template as a basis for a furniture-related landing page.
* Replace images in the `Img/` folder with your own.
* Edit content sections (hero text, features, about, etc.) in `index.html`.
* Modify or extend the CSS in `style.css` to suit your brand’s style.
